# 4.1.-SpringFrameworkB_N3
This exercise involves testing two different Spring Boot projects (one Maven and one Gradle) using Postman with environment variables.

## Objectives
Create two Postman environments:
- Maven Project
- Gradle Project

Each environment should include the following variables:
- server: http://localhost
- port: 9000 for the Maven project & 9001 for the Gradle project

Test the APIs using URLs like: http://localhost:9000/HelloWorld?name=Meritxell or http://localhost:9001/HelloWorld?name=Meritxell
Take screenshots showing the request and response from Postman using the correct environment.
Export your Postman environments as JSON files and submit them along with the screenshots.
